📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based simulation of a binary distillation column developed using the McCabe–Thiele graphical method. The application helps users visualize and understand the stage-by-stage separation process in a distillation column by constructing equilibrium curves, operating lines, and theoretical stages.

The tool is designed for chemical engineering students and practitioners to explore how operating conditions affect column performance.

🎯 Objective

To model a binary distillation column using the McCabe–Thiele method

To calculate the number of theoretical stages required for separation

To visualize equilibrium and operating lines interactively

To provide an educational and intuitive interface for distillation analysis

⚙️ Methodology – McCabe–Thiele Principle

The McCabe–Thiele method is a graphical technique used to design binary distillation columns under steady-state conditions. It is based on:

Vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data

Mass balance equations for rectifying and stripping sections

Graphical stepping between operating lines and the equilibrium curve

The number of steps drawn corresponds to the number of theoretical stages in the column.
